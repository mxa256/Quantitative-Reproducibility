# Quantitative-Reproducibility
R script for analysis for Quantitative Reproducibility study by Mona Ascha.

This is the analysis script for our study, titled "Reproducible Research Practices in the Plastic Surgery Literature." The study examines characteristics of a random sample of 300 plastic surgery publications obtained through a pubmed search. Characteristics of those publications were then entered into a Google Form, and saved as an excel file. The script analysis several of these collected characteristics and calculates confidence intervals for proportions for selected data.
